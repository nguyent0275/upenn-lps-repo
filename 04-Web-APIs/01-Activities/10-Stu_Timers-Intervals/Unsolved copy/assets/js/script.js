// * As a developer, I want to create a speed-reading application that prints a single word of a message at a time.

// ## Acceptance Criteria

// * It's done when the number of seconds left on the countdown is printed on the screen.

// * It's done when, after the countdown of 5 seconds ends, the words of the message appear on the screen, one word at a time.


var timerEl = document.getElementById('countdown');
var mainEl = document.getElementById('main');

var message =
  'Some say the world will end in ðŸ”¥, Some say in ice. From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate. To say that for destruction ice, Is also great, And would suffice.';
  // splitting the message variable up by words and not letters, the (' ') is checking for spaces which is between words
var words = message.split(' ');

function countdown() {
  var timeLeft = 5;

  // TODO: Use the `setInterval()` method to call a function to be executed every 1000 milliseconds
  var timeInterval = setInterval(function() {
    // "--" is ticking the timeLeft variable of 5 down by a second at a time
    timeLeft--;
    // displaying the timeLeft with, "seconds left in a textarea in the html's main
    timerEl.textContent = timeLeft + " seconds left.";
    // if the timer hits 0 seconds, the timer will dissapear and run the displayMessage function on line 39.
